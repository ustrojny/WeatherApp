# WeatherApp
Live demo: https://ustrojny.github.io/WeatherApp/
## Description
This project has been realized as an excercise at Coders Camp.
The application connects to the weather API (https://openweathermap.org/current) to display the current weather for the given location.
- you can check the weather for your current location (you have to agree to access to your location)
- you can search the city from the given list (filtered [json file from the weather API](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/))
## I have used in this project:
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/guides/) for date parsing
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) for sorting (`sortBy`, `uniqBy`)
- [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) for some basic styles
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for spinner icons
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) 
## How to build the project
Type in the command line: `npm run script build`
