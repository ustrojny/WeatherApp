# WeatherApp
Live demo: https://ustrojny.github.io/WeatherApp/
## Description
This project has been realized as an excercise at Coders Camp.
The application connects to the weather API (https://openweathermap.org/current) to display the current weather for the given location.
- you can check the weather for your current location (you have to agree to access to your location)
- you can search the city from the given list (filtered [json file from the weather API](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/))
## Technologies / tools
I have used in this project:
- JavaScript and some basic Typescript
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/guides/) for data parsing
- [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) for some basic styles
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for spinner icons
## How to build the project
Type in the command line: `npm run script build`
